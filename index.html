<h2>WorldWideWeb</h2>
WorldWideWeb (later renamed to Nexus to avoid confusion between the software and the World Wide Web) was the first web browser[1] and editor.[2] It was discontinued in 1994. At the time it was written, it was the sole web browser in existence,[1] as well as the first WYSIWYG HTML editor.
