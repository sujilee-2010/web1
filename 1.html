<img src="family.jpg" width="100%"> Photo by Liv Bruce on Unsplash<p style="margin-top:40px;">Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.

  It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.</p>
<p>Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.</p>
Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
